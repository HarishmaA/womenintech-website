## Pull request [#30](https://github.com/womenintech-chennai/womenintech-website/pull/30) by [Nikhil Kumaran S](https://github.com/Nikhil-Kumaran)

- In the company which I'm working on, we are using precommit hooks which performs linting and formatting the code before push it to the remote repo. This way we can maintain a standard coding style throughout our project even though many people are contributing to it.

Packages used: `husky`, `lint-staged`, `pretty-quick`.
